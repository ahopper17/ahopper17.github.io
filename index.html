        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a recent Carleton College grad with a passion for math, neuroscience, and coding. My curiosity drives me to explore new ideas and learn something new every day.</p>
        <p>As a native Minnesotan, the great outdoors is where I'm happiest. Whether I'm running, hiking, or simply enjoying a good book, you'll likely find me embracing the fresh air. And if you spot me in the summer, don't hesitate to ask about my super stylish watch tan!</p>
        <p>I'm forever grateful to my parents for introducing me to the world from a young age. At 22, I've traveled to twenty different countries, a few of which were solo adventures. If I could visit every country, I would. I'm endlessly fascinated by the diversity of people, cultures, and environments, and I'm always eager to learn how these differences shape our experiences and perspectives. Each journey has deepened my understanding and appreciation of the world's incredible variety.</p>
        <p>My main hobbies are reading, running, and puzzle solving. Check out what I read under the "Books" tab! When it comes to puzzle solving, crosswords are my bread and butter, but I also love a variant sudoku. I've gotten quick, solving the New York Times Monday crossword in 2 minutes, 45 seconds. For variant sudokus, I play puzzles from Cracking the Cryptic. I've got some tools to help me in solving under "Puzzles".</p>
        <p>When interacting with humans, I'm fluent in Russian and proficient in French. If I'm communicating with a computer, I can do it in Python, Java, C++, LaTeX, and Excel. I'm also capable in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, demonstrated by the existence of this website. </p>
